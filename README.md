# VideoEditor SDK React Native Example App

This project shows how to integrate [VideoEditor SDK](https://www.videoeditorsdk.com/?utm_campaign=Projects&utm_source=Github&utm_medium=VESDK&utm_content=React-Native-Demo) into a React Native application with the [React Native module for VideoEditor SDK](https://github.com/imgly/vesdk-react-native) which is available via NPM as [`react-native-videoeditorsdk`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-videoeditorsdk).

## Getting started

After cloning this repository, perform the following steps to run the example application:

```sh
# install
yarn install
cd ios && pod install && cd .. # CocoaPods on iOS needs this extra step
# run
yarn react-native run-ios
# or
yarn react-native run-android
```

## Unlock the SDK

VideoEditor SDK is a product of img.ly GmbH. Without unlocking, the SDK is fully functional but a watermark is added on top of the video preview and any exported videos.
In order to remove the watermark and to use VideoEditor SDK within your app **you'll need to [request a license](https://account.photoeditorsdk.com/pricing?product=vesdk&?utm_campaign=Projects&utm_source=Github&utm_medium=VESDK&utm_content=React-Native-Demo) for each platform and load the license file(s)** in your [`App.js`](./App.js#L30-L36) with the following single line of code that automatically resolves multiple license files via [platform-specific file extensions](https://reactnative.dev/docs/platform-specific-code#platform-specific-extensions):

```js
VESDK.unlockWithLicense(require('./vesdk_license'));
```

## VideoEditor SDK for iOS & Android

The React Native module for VideoEditor SDK includes a rich set of most commonly used [configuration and customization options](https://github.com/imgly/vesdk-react-native/blob/master/configuration.ts) of VideoEditor SDK for iOS and Android. The native frameworks provide **fully customizable** video editors. Please refer to [our documentation](https://docs.videoeditorsdk.com?utm_campaign=Projects&utm_source=Github&utm_medium=VESDK&utm_content=React-Native-Demo) for more details.

Native customization for iOS is demonstrated in the [`AppDelegate`](./ios/VESDKExample/AppDelegate.m#L36-L47) of the example application.
